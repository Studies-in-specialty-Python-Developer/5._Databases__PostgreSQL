# 5._Databases__PostgreSQL

This project contains tasks for independent work in the Databases PostgreSQL course. Since these are training assignments, 
no error handling was used, and clean code rules were not followed.
The Databases PostgreSQL course contains lessons on the following topics:
1. Creating infrastructure
2. Basic PostgreSQL data types and simple queries
3. Joining of tables (JOIN) and subqueries
4. Other objects of databases: views and functions
5. Database design. DDL - managing databases and database objects
